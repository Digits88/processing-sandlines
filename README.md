# Processing Sandlines

This Sketch is inspired by Anders Hoffâ€™s [Sand Splines](http://inconvergent.net/generative/sand-spline/).
Draw a series of overlapping horizontal lines. As the x position increases, make the line more erratic.
Move down the canvas vertically and repeat this process, with each movement down the canvas making the
volatility of the lines more pronounced.
